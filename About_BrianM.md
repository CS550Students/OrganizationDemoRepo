#Brian's Username:
The name *sushimaster1999* was chosen at a young age. At one point Brian was the head of an organization dedicated to the love of sushi. When people first joined they were a sushi recruit, then through training and dedication you became a sushi aprrentice, afterwards a sushi journeyman, and finally a sushi master. There were only ever two sushi masters, Brian and one other person named Bryce, who worked his way up to that position through 2 years of dedicated work to the organization. There were 4 sushi Journeymen, and many sushi apprentces and recruits. The sushi master part of his username is actually a sense of great accomplishment within the sushi organization, while the 1999 part is the year he was born. It is sometimes excluded from his username.
